## PART 1: PROPOSE A TECHNICAL SOLUTION AND STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS

## Business problem: 

you are ingesting a large amount of data for unidirectional 'trips' of motor vehicles from one latitude/longitude to another in the USA. 
Each row of the data set comes from 'connected cars' which consist of GPS positioning per vehicle, refreshed every 5 minutes. 
Your clients want to understand the basic demography (age/gender) of the occupants of each vehicle that traverses a particular roadway every day.

## Your objective: 

Propose the basic data model, data architecture, ETL scripts (if any), and data sets necessary to infer person-level demography 
from the 'origin location' (i.e. the initial starting point) of each vehicle on each roadway. 

Identify the specific functional and technical assumptions you would make to infer demography and the data sets you would use. 
You may use any public or commercial data set available within the United States.
